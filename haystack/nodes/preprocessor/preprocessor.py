                                      The tabular structures in documents might be noise for the reader model if it
                                      does not have table parsing capability for finding answers. However, tables
                                      may also have long strings that could possible candidate for searching answers.
                                      The rows containing strings are thus retained in this option.
        :param pre_split_paragraphs: Whether to split the text into paragraphs before splitting it into smaller chunks.
                            This is useful if you want the chunking to only happen within paragraphs, so as to maintain maximum context for vector embeddings
        :param split_by: Unit for splitting the document. Can be "word", "sentence", or "passage". Set to None to disable splitting.
        :param split_length: Max. number of the above split unit (e.g. words) that are allowed in one document. For instance, if n -> 10 & split_by ->
                           "sentence", then each output document will have 10 sentences.
        :param split_overlap: Word overlap between two adjacent documents after a split.
                              Setting this to a positive number essentially enables the sliding window approach.
                              For example, if split_by -> `word`,
                              split_length -> 5 & split_overlap -> 2, then the splits would be like:
                              [w1 w2 w3 w4 w5, w4 w5 w6 w7 w8, w7 w8 w10 w11 w12].
                              Set the value to 0 to ensure there is no overlap among the documents after splitting.
        :param split_respect_sentence_boundary: Whether to split in partial sentences if split_by -> `word`. If set
                                                to True, the individual split will always have complete sentences &
                                                the number of words will be <= split_length.
        :param language: The language used by "nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize" in iso639 format.
            Available options: "ru","sl","es","sv","tr","cs","da","nl","en","et","fi","fr","de","el","it","no","pl","pt","ml"
        :param tokenizer_model_folder: Path to the folder containing the NTLK PunktSentenceTokenizer models, if loading a model from a local path. Leave empty otherwise.
        :param id_hash_keys: Generate the document id from a custom list of strings that refer to the document's
            attributes. If you want to ensure you don't have duplicate documents in your DocumentStore but texts are
            not unique, you can modify the metadata and pass e.g. `"meta"` to this field (e.g. [`"content"`, `"meta"`]).
            In this case the id will be generated by using the content and the defined metadata.
        :param progress_bar: Whether to show a progress bar.
        :param add_page_number: Add the number of the page a paragraph occurs in to the Document's meta
                                field `"page"`. Page boundaries are determined by `"\f"' character which is added
                                in between pages by `PDFToTextConverter`, `TikaConverter`, `ParsrConverter` and
                                `AzureConverter`. If a doc's text spans multiple pages, the page number of the
                                first page is added to the meta field.
        :param merge_short: Whether to merge short paragraphs into the previous paragraph. This is useful for PDFs
                            where paragraphs are split across pages and the last paragraph of a page is very short.
                            Set to a number of characters to merge paragraphs shorter than that number. Default is 10 characters, set to 0 to disable.
        :param merge_lowercase: Whether to merge paragraphs that start with a lowercase letter into the previous
                                paragraph. This is useful for PDFs where paragraphs are split across pages and the
                                first paragraph of a page starts with a lowercase letter.
        :param remove_linebreaks: Whether to remove line breaks from the text. This is useful for PDFs where
                                      paragraphs are split across pages and the last paragraph of a page ends with a
                                        line break.
        :param max_chars_check: the maximum length a document is expected to have. Each document that is longer than max_chars_check in characters after pre-processing will raise a warning.
